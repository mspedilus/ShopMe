# ShopMe

ShopMe is a MERN stack eCommerce website built using React, MongoDB, Express server, NodeJS, and JSON Web Tokens. It uses the ASOS API, https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/asos2, and implements HTTP requests to retreive products from the ASOS catalog. Users can browse the ShopMe catalog, add items and make changes to their shopping bag, create an account/login, make purchases, view their profile and purchase history, and edit their profile information.
